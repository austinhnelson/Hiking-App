This folder contains a Java-based REST API and server for saving and retrieving data to/from the MySQL database located
at 172.232.171.163. The update_server scripts will trigger the server to pull from the github repo, recompile the source
code, and restart the server. For these scripts to work, the sshkey file needs to be present. (It needs to be REMOVED
BEFORE RELEASE as it is a huge security risk.)

Database tables can be added and edited by creating additional class files and adding the routes in App.java
To edit an existing table, the existing table will need to be dropped from the database. Then a new one with the correct
structure will be created.

Inserting to a table:
POST http://172.232.171.163:4567/TABLE_NAME_OR_ALIAS?PARAMETER_NAME=VALUE&PARAMETER_2=...

e.g.
POST http://172.232.171.163:4567/route?name=my_route&points=jsonData
POST http://172.232.171.163:4567/userPost?username=my_name&routeID=1&comment=something+about+the+hike

The response content will be the id assigned to the entry (useful for lookup and such).
Spaces in string values must be replaced with +'s (%20 may also work)

Retrieving from a table:
GET http://172.232.171.163:4567/TABLE_NAME_OR_ALIAS/ID

e.g.
GET http://172.232.171.163:4567/userPosts/1

The response content will be JSON data

To get all, replace ID with 'all'
e.g.
GET http://172.232.171.163:4567/userPosts/all

To get all posts by a specific user:
GET http://172.232.171.163:4567/userPosts?username=USERNAME
